1. Write and explain the centralized algorithm to implement total order and causal order of messages. Write the drawbacks and the complexity of the algorithm.

2. Explain in detail how termination detection can be achieved using distributed snapshots.

3.Explain the total order, which requires that all messages be received in the same order by the recipients of the messages

4. Exaplain termination detection by weight throwing

5. explain Designing of a (centralized) algorithm to create a propagation tree satisfying the properties.

6. Expalin State the atomic model of execution in detial.

7. Expalin classes of sourceâ€“destination relationships for multicast algorithms

8.  demonstrate causal ordering if closed groups are assumed for multicast algorithms
9.  demonstrate  total ordering for multicast algorithms.
